Within the board game section, users are presented with a slider allowing them to indicate the number of players for a game. Users click the randomizer button within either the board game or drink box to randomly generate a suggestion for the respective category. Random generated suggestions appear in their respective cards with a title, picture and save button. Additionally, when a board game suggestion is generated, a description button will appear that, on clicking, will present the user with a description of the game in a modal. Similarly, within the Drink card, a "Make this Drink" button will appear upon suggestion generation and when clicked the user will be provided a modal with ingredients and directions for making the drink. !!!!The users can click the image to be redirected to game/drink page (delete if not)!!!!. Users can click the save button at the bottom of the card to save a favorite suggestion to the respective list on the right side of the page. Clicking a saved favorite from the favorites list will repopulate the suggestion information in the respective card and eliminate the suggestion from the saved favorites list . Users can generate a new suggestion with the randomizer button at the top of the card at any time.
